Build an e-commerce shopping cart application using NextJS or SvelteKit. The application will feature a product listing page showcasing various products with details and an "Add to Cart" functionality. Additionally, a dedicated cart page will allow users to manage items, including quantity adjustments, removal, and total price calculations with potential discounts.
Technical Specifications:
Frontend Framework: ReactJS or Svlete
Styling: Tailwind or Plain CSS
Data Source:
Option 1: Create a local JSON file containing product data (product name, image, price, description, etc.)
Option 2: Utilize an open-source API to fetch product data dynamically
Detailed Features:
Product Listing Page:
Display at least 6-10 products using a grid layout
Each product card should include:
Product image
Product name
Product price (formatted for currency)
"Add to Cart" button
Add to Cart Functionality:
Clicking the "Add to Cart" button on a product should:
Add the chosen product to a user's virtual shopping cart.
Update the cart icon or a dedicated counter to reflect the number of added items (optional).
Provide visual feedback (e.g., animation) confirming the item's addition.
Cart Page:
Display a dedicated cart page where users can manage their selected products.
The cart page should include:
A list of all added products, displaying:
Product image
Product name
Product price
Quantity selector (up/down buttons or input field) to adjust the amount of each item.
"Remove Item" button to delete a specific product from the cart.
Cart summary section:
Subtotal: Calculate the total cost of all items in the cart based on their quantity and price.
Discounts (optional): Implement the ability to apply discounts on the total price. This could involve:
Fixed discounts (e.g., "$10 off")
Percentage discounts (e.g., "10% off")
Total price (including discounts): Display the final price the user needs to pay.
Checkout button (optional): This can redirect to a simulated checkout page or provide a message indicating successful cart addition.
Evaluation Criteria:
Code Logic and Cleanliness:
Well-structured, readable, and maintainable code with proper indentation and comments.
Efficient use of state management to keep track of products and cart items.
Design Symmetry:
Consistent layout and user interface throughout the application.
Responsive design to adjust for different screen sizes.
Reusable Components:
Create reusable components for product cards, cart items, and other common UI elements.
Completeness of Features:
Implement all listed features with proper functionality.
Go above and beyond (optional):
Note: This will not be the primary point of evaluation, but in case of a tie, this will be the deciding factor.
Consider implementing error handling for scenarios like invalid quantity input or discount codes.
Explore user authentication for persistent cart storage across sessions (optional).
Build the backend in any language of your choice

Navigation & State Management
You can use the useState hook for basic state management in this example, but if your app grows more complex, consider integrating a state management solution like Redux or the Context API.

Youâ€™ll also need to add a basic navigation bar and a cart icon with the item count, which can be done in a layout component or directly in your pages.
